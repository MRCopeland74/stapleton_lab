## Purpose
Better combinations of genes within corn crops due to genetic modification can result in a better harvest. These combinations of genes can further be altered to maximize the harvest in various environment conditions such as low rainfall/poor irrigation, low nitrogen levels, or with the presence of a pathogen or in almagamation of these factors. Farmers can assess the environmental conditions and thus, determine the most favorable genotype to grow in their landscape for the best crop yield.
