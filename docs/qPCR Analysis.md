# qPCR Analysis
## Introduction
In order to conduct our research, two factors must be assessed for each of our samples of maize: the breed type and the amount of stress-product present. Fortunately, the former was recorded upon collection. Determining the latter, however, is a much more involved process. To this end we use Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR), a technique that utilizes spectroscopy to measure gene expression. Given a genetic sample, qPCR determines the amount of a specified RNA sequence by assessing the fluorescence in the DNA. The fluorescence is measured by qPCR in 40 cycles and the cycle in which the amount of fluorescence passes a specified threshold is known as the cycle threshold (Ct) value.   

A brief outline of qPCR is to follow.
